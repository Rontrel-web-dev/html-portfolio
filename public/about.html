<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, I’m Rontrel – a 
  passionate and hardworking learner on a journey to become a 
  skilled web developer. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code,
  and I’m always excited to learn new technologies, collaborate with others,
  and grow as a creator. Whether I’m fixing a bug at 2 AM or celebrating a breakthrough, 
  I’m here because I love it.</p>

<p>
  Outside of coding, I’m deeply into video editing and gaming.
  I edit gaming content with motion tracking, subtitles, effects, and sound design to keep videos fun and engaging. 
  I love turning raw footage into something that tells a story or makes people laugh. 
  Whether it's horror challenges or fast-paced gameplay, 
  I’m always looking to level up my skills and create something memorable.
